High level plan for project structure:

Content script
  Search DOM for:
    listingInformation[] = [{
      destinationLocation,
      dates,
      guests: {
        numAdults,
        numChildren,
        numInfants
      }
    }]

  Get additional info from the widgets placed on the page:
    {
      showPricePerNight,
    }

  -> Sends this to the background script with an ID

  <- Receives an object from the background script flightPricesData

  Render flightPricesData

Popup 
  Set the user preferences:
    userPreferences = {
      departingLocation: string,
      findInboundTickets: bool,
      findOutboundTickets: bool,
      multipleDepartingLocations: object[],
      travelClassPreference: string,
      airlineWhiteList[],
      airlineBlackList[],
      maxStops: number, (when 0, api call is set to nonStop)
      maxPrice: number,
      currencyCode: string, (inferred from the content script - maybe extension API has this info also),
      latestDeparture,
      earliestDeparture,
      latestArrival,
      earliestArrival,
      showPricePerNight
    }

  Click a button to apply user settings


Background script

  <- Receive userPreferences from Popup
  <- Receive listingInformation[] from Content script

  Convert destination and departure location:
  {
    destinatinoAirportCode,
    departingAirportCode
  }

  Call API given airportCodes, userPreferences, listingInformation[]:
    ... Cache identical queries (e.g. same airports, same dates) to reduce API calls


  Assemble an object for the content script (flightPricesData):
  {
    cheapestFlight : {

    }
    flightList: [{}...]
  }

  -> Send object to content script for rendering (flightPricesData)
